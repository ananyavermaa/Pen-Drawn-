# Pen-Drawn-

Have you ever thought of neural networks starting to recognize doodling? Here’s presenting to you “Pen Drawn” based on a futher applocation of Google’s Quick Draw.Quick Draw! is a Google-developed online game in which users are challenged to draw a representation of an item or idea, and the game then utilizes artificial intelligence to estimate what the drawings represent .“Pen Drawn” takes it a step further as it allows user to virtually draw on the screen keeping their videos on and having a more fun experience.
Firstly ,lets have a look at Quick Draw : https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/

**Dataset 🗃️**

Follow the documentation here to get the dataset. I got .npy files from google cloud for 14 drawings.

**Code Requirements:**

Install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
pip install opencv-python 
pip install keras
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
pip install scipy


**Setup 🖥️**

1) Step1: Instal necessary packages

2) Step 2 : Clone/download QuickDraw project from my repository.
 
3) Step 3: Download dataset from which you want to train model from here https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset

4) Step 4: Keep downloaded dataset in folder 'data'.

5) Step 5: Run readDataset.py to load dataset.

6) Step 6: Use trainModel.py to train CNN model, This may take some time depend on configuration of system.

7) Step 7: Run runWebCam.py to test developed model.
